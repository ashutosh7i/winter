# Bagpack Security Tracker

## Summary

What are you going to build?
i am calling it Bagpack Security Tracker, it is a Security system which will be used to protect bags & the content of bag.
As a college student we carry valueable things like laptop & cash in our bag, Sometimes it gets stolen or lostðŸ˜¢.
Few months back someone stole cash from my bag too, So i started plannnig to make a device by which we can secure and track our bags.

What does it do?
The device uses a ESP32 with GSM module- to get location, lock/unlock bag, get alerts and video feed.
GPS module for location,Solenoid to open and lock Zippers, a RFID module to open bag with a tapðŸ˜‰,a camera module to get feed.
Device can be charged externally, i have created a port for that,led and Buzzers for alerting, a FM module for feed transmission.
And a 3d pen to create enclosures, i have rest of required tools.

Why are you excited to build it?
Being a Techie & Electronic hobbyist i try to solve Modern Problems in a Modern way; i am planning for this device since a long time now, but i didn't had time and funds, but now my exams are over so i can focus more on this project, electronics always excites me and when it comes to Hackathons, i'm always up to it.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it?
First of all i will create a schematic and will test all equipments and connection in an open bread board to test the values and limits of devices.
Then i will test gsm connection, Code everything up, When everything work as intended then i will assemble everthing in a enclosure, fix the camera, all the modules, the solenoid lock and GPS on their appropriate places,To do this i will use 3d pen to create enclosures.
I will be using Soldering iron, Multimeter, usb to TTl converter, screws, bolts and Threads, as far as tools are concerned i have appropriate tools.
I will test modules for a day, Code for two days, assembly will take two days, then if everything works as planned, i will complete my project in under 7 days
