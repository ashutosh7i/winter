# Bagpack Security Tracker

## Summary

What are you going to build?
i am calling it Bagpack Security Tracker, it is a Security system which will be used to protect bags & the content of bag.
As a college student we carry valueable things like laptop & cash in our bag, Sometimes it gets stolen or lostðŸ˜¢.
Few months back someone stole cash from my bag too, So i started plannnig to make a device by which we can secure and track our bags.

What does it do?
The device uses a ESP32 with GSM module- to get location, lock/unlock bag, get alerts and video feed.
GPS module for location,Solenoid to open and lock Zippers, a RFID module to open bag with a tapðŸ˜‰,a camera module to get feed.
Device can be charged externally, i have created a port for that,led and Buzzers for alerting, a FM module for feed transmission.
And a 3d pen to create enclosures, i have rest of required tools.

Why are you excited to build it?

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
